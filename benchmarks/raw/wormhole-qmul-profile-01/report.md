## Lifecycle

One host process created Wormhole device 0 once, executed every listed case, and closed it once.
Device 1 was not opened or used.

## Timing contract

The primary elapsed field remains prepared-workload device time. Additive phase records expose device creation, buffer allocation, program build, H2D, prewarm synchronization, warmup, each measured sample, D2H, cleanup, device close, and host process end-to-end time.

This is a first persistent-device hardware sample. It is not a stability result, acceleration claim, or CPU comparison.
